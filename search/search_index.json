Context The product's primary goal is to create a simple and effective environment for small companies, universities, and bioinformaticians to run their pipelines from their machines without a lot of configuration or cloud. Objective In this project, my challenge was to propose improvements to the beta version of the service. The Process I use the fundamentals of Design Thinking to build all new processes or ideas. Empathise Research I usually began the research with desk research to understand the User. While doing this desk research, I make a CSD (Certainties, Suppositions, and Doubts) Matrix. It's a technique that you can use to define the scope of some new challenge, and I usually use it before interviews to clearly understand the minimum I need to know about the User. The matrix has three columns: 1) what is already known, 2) hypotheses raised, and 3) what is still unknown and needs to be investigated. Then, being the CSD matrix ready, I start to listen to the users. Define In this step, I take the information I got in the research and define some crucial aspects to move on. Some of these aspects are the Target audience, User's pains, User's goals, and Competitors. Competitors Analysis I identified the companies that have the closest services to analyze your features, how they talk with your target audience and what I could do better. List of Competitors - https://tower.nf/ - https://www.prefect.io/ - https://airflow.apache.org/ - https://github.com/features/actions Ideate Sketch The sketch is a quick way to put ideas on the paper and test with the stakeholders. Prototype Solution The solution's main goal was to reach simplicity without losing the many features that make the system a robust tool. Design System The beta version was built only using the Bootstrap default components and colors. In this new version, the stakeholders wish to give a personality for the brand, so I worked on an initial design system for the project. Design decisions In the initial research, I noticed that the interfaces of this kind of application are crowded. Too many features and data may cause distraction and confusion. So I worked on a clean design with components that could be reused in different parts of the flow. I chose to change the orientation of the cards to make better use of the screen space and decrease the vertical scrolling that existed on small screens. This pattern is also good in mobile interfaces because we could use labels on the side. Test The \"final test\" is usability Testing performed by me with a sample of the system's users in the Figma prototype. The idea was approved with some minor changes. What did I Learn? I improved my experience using Figma to design the UI templates; To use more the \"paper-prototype\" to validate initial ideas.","title":"Dockgrid"},{"location":"projects/dockgrid/#dockgrid","text":"Dockgrid is an easy-to-use data analysis orchestration tool for distributed computing.","title":"Dockgrid"},{"location":"projects/dockgrid/#context","text":"The product's primary goal is to create a simple and effective environment for small companies, universities, and bioinformaticians to run their pipelines from their machines without a lot of configuration or cloud.","title":"Context"},{"location":"projects/dockgrid/#objective","text":"In this project, my challenge was to propose improvements to the beta version of the service.","title":"Objective"},{"location":"projects/dockgrid/#the-process","text":"I use the fundamentals of Design Thinking to build all new processes or ideas.","title":"The Process"},{"location":"projects/dockgrid/#empathise","text":"","title":"Empathise"},{"location":"projects/dockgrid/#research","text":"I usually began the research with desk research to understand the User.
