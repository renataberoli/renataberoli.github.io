#Dockgrid
> Dockgrid is an easy-to-use data analysis orchestration tool for distributed computing.

## Context
The product's primary goal is to create a simple and effective environment for small companies, universities, 
and bioinformaticians to run their pipelines from their machines without a lot of configuration or cloud.

## Objective
In this project, my challenge was to propose improvements to the beta version of the service.


## The Process
I use the fundamentals of Design Thinking to build all new processes or ideas.

## Empathise

#### Research
I usually began the research with desk research to understand the User. While doing this desk research, 
I make a CSD (Certainties, Suppositions, and Doubts) Matrix. It's a technique that you can use to define the
scope of some new challenge, and I usually use it before interviews to clearly understand the minimum I need 
to know about the User. The matrix has three columns: 1) what is already known, 2) hypotheses raised, and 
3) what is still unknown and needs to be investigated. Then, being the CSD matrix ready, I start to listen to 
the users.

## Define
In this step, I take the information I got in the research and define some crucial aspects to move on. Some of 
these aspects are the Target audience, User's pains, User's goals, and Competitors.

#### Competitors Analysis
I identified the companies that have the closest services to analyze your features, how they talk with your target 
audience and what I could do better.

## Ideate

#### Sketch
The sketch is a quick way to put ideas on the paper and test with the stakeholders.

## Prototype

#### Solution
The solution's main goal was to reach simplicity without losing the many features that make the system a robust tool.

#### Design System
The beta version was built only using the Bootstrap default components and colors. In this new version, the 
stakeholders wish to give a personality for the brand, so I worked on an initial design system for the project. 

#### Design decisions
In the initial research, I noticed that the interfaces of this kind of application are crowded. 
Too many features and data may cause distraction and confusion. So I worked on a clean design with components 
that could be reused in different parts of the flow. 

I chose to change the orientation of the cards to make better use of the screen space and decrease the vertical 
scrolling that existed on small screens. This pattern is also good in mobile interfaces because we could use 
labels on the side.

## Test
The "final test" is usability Testing performed by me with a sample of the system's users in the Figma prototype. 
The idea was approved with some minor changes. 

## What did I Learn?
- I improved my experience using  Figma to design the UI templates;
- To use more the "paper-prototype" to validate initial ideas.
