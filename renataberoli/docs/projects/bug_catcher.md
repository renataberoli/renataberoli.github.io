### About the project
Bug catcher is a pet-project loosely inspired by GitHub Issues and designed with the primary goal of improving my skills in the
Django framework.

#### Sketch

The sketch is the most basic structure I designed within the project. Therefore, it's an excellent opportunity to put 
the ideas on paper and start initial tests. Also, working as a developer, I use the sketch to understand structures of
information and draw the models I need in order to create my system.

#### The solution
After sketching the interfaces and the system architecture, I translate my sketch into a coding interface with Bootstrap 
patterns.

#### Responsive layout
My main objective for the project is creating a desktop system. I was careful to keep all the interfaces responsible, 
as most of the web accesses are from mobile devices.

- [x] Create a series of list filters to help the user find what he wants.
- [x] Create a login and authentication flow.
- [x] Improve the UI to meet the mockups design before.
- [x] Improve the software's documentation.
- [x] Write some basic tests to make sure that the system is working as expected.
