## Context - Gut microbiome report
As usual in the beta version, the first reports of these tests were just a massive amount of text. 
Thus, quality content was difficult to assimilate because the doctor had a short time in the consultation. 
So our challenge was to translate the complex biological data (text) into visual data easier to understand. 
Here is a sample of the solution:
##### One-page review - Gut microbiome

## Context - COVID-19 report
With the coronavirus pandemic, we start to do the covid-19 test. So, I designed this template thinking about 
reducing the time scan of the page's content. I worked to make the result and the Qrcode the attention points 
of the report because it's the essential content for this kind of report.

##### COVID-19 report
