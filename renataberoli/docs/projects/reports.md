## Gut microbiome report

### Context 

The company started developing a new product based on 16S amplicon sequencing to aid in the diagnostic of digestive 
issues.

### The data

A typical result (generated by the bioinformatics team) would give a count table with organisms and their relative 
abundance in the patient microbiome.

### The report

Given the commercial model chosen for the product, results were presented in a report, formatted as a PDF file instead 
of a web application.

The conclusions were drawn from the data based on:

- scientific literature
- patient symptom's 
- the company historical data of patients and healthy individuals 
- specialized algorithms
 
### The challenge

The project posed exciting challenges, to quote a few: 

- Data density
- Conclusion characteristics
- Uneven audience background (medical doctors, nutritionists, and patients).

### The solution

 1. The report can't present a diagnostic; the most crucial piece of information is binary: "Balanced/Unbalanced 
    gut flora."
 2. Without a definitive diagnosis, we provide both quantitative and qualitative data on the Bacteria detected by 
    the product to help doctors and nutritionists decide their course of action.
 3. For some features, we show the patient how he compares with the general population.
 4. We present literature connecting some features to patient symptoms. 
 

### One-page review

A full report is composed of multiple pages, here I present the "Overview" page with some elements discussed
in this portfolio article:

### Conclusion

The first version of the report was just a massive amount of text, with proved difficult for doctors and patients
to assimilate. During the course of this project, we manage to translate the textual biological data into visual 
components, with make things easier to grasp.

## Context - COVID-19 report

With the coronavirus pandemic, we start to do the covid-19 test. So, I designed this template thinking about
reducing the time scan of the page's content. I worked to make the result and the Qrcode the attention points
of the report because it's the essential content for this kind of report.
