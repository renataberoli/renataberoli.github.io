## Context
The Neobiome platform represents a complete solution for quality monitoring and a strategic 
decision-making tool based on microbiome information. With our platform, we provide support 
in the areas of contamination and outbreak tracking and control, risk management, process 
improvement, food safety, and good practices for microbiological control.

## The Solution
I worked in the dashboard of this system

![Neobiome dashboard](https://github.com/renataberoli/renataberoli.github.io/blob/main/renataberoli/docs/img/neobiome%20dashboard.png?raw=true)

and the redesign of some components and graphs to improve the user's experience
